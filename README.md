# Working-with-GO

This repo is for me to learn and make small programs with the GO Lang Language
- I am interested in this language as it is up and coming to working with cloud computing and seems to be well liked in the community

# Getting Started
- You must donwload GO on your machine
- Once Downloaded open your terminal and run "go version"
	- This should show you what version of GO you have and to confirm the download was a success
- Then clone this repo, into your respective folder
- Once done, open terminal and go to the path where you copied this git repo
- Once in project, to execute each respective go file, run either
	- go run "fileName".go, this will execute the file once runtime has been build for instance
	- go build "fileName".go, then execute the executable that was compiled
